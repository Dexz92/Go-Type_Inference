# Go-Type_Inference
A compiler that supports a subset of the language Go, with focus on type inference.

## Building the  project ##
To build the compiler for the first time, use the following commands:

    cd Go-Type_Inference/Go
    ant build

## Automated tests ##
To run all the tests located in the *testfiles* directory, run the command:

    ant test

## Using the compiler ##
The compiler is generated by using the command:

    ant jar

The compiler (GoCompiler.jar) will be placed in the *Go* directory, to use it, run it like a jar-file that takes one file as input, for example: 

    java -jar GoCompiler.jar testfiles/interpreter/ageTest.go

## AST output ##
If you are interested in the ast-output of a file, add the option *ast* after the file when you run the compiler, like this:

    java -jar GoCompiler.jar testfiles/interpreter/ageTest.go ast

## Subset ##
To see in more detail what is supported by the subset in case you want to write your own input for compiler, check the *GoCoverage.txt* file.
